## Part A
1. Simulate a three nodes point – to – point network with duplex links
between them. Set the queue size and vary the bandwidth and find the
number of packets dropped.
Simulate a four node point-to-point network with the links connected as
follows:
n0 – n2, n1 – n2 and n2 – n3. Apply TCP agent between n0-n3 and UDP
between n1-n3. Apply relevant applications over TCP and UDP agents
changing the parameter and determine the number of packets sent by
TCP / UDP.

2. Simulate the transmission of ping messages over a network topology
consisting of 6 nodes and find the number of packets dropped due to
congestion.

3. Simulate an Ethernet LAN using n nodes (6-10), change error rate and
data rate and compare throughput.

4. Simulate an Ethernet LAN using n nodes and set multiple traffic nodes
and plot congestion window for different source / destination.

5. Simulate simple ESS and with transmitting nodes in wire-less LAN by
simulation and determine the performance with respect to transmission of
packets.

## Part B
> Implement the following in C/C++:

7. Write a program for error detecting code using CRC-CCITT (16- bits).

8. Write a program for distance vector algorithm to find suitable path for
transmission.

9. Using TCP/IP sockets, write a client – server program to make the client
send the file name and to make the server send back the contents of the
requested file if present.

10. Implement the above program using as message queues or FIFOs as IPC
channels.

11. Write a program for simple RSA algorithm to encrypt and decrypt the
data.

12. Write a program for congestion control using leaky bucket algorithm.
